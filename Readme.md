# Personal list about blockchains

A developer view.

From Good to Databases.

All opinions are personal. 

### Good

#### - Bitcoin 

For both payments and OP_RETURN based use cases, Bitcoin gets the top place. It has the most hashrate (security/immutability). It is easy to develop on. You can inspect the chain and validate scripts easily. You can build a lot of cool stuff on top of OP_RETURN (have a think about this). Bitcoin is a real blockchain. The asset is the strongest amongst all the other. You can use payment channels to get around high fees. If you think you need a "layer 2" option now, you can use a second chain (LTC/BCH for example or a non-pow one, depending on the use cases). You can do cross chain atomic swaps  (lower fees / faster transactions).   

I'm not a big fan of LN as it stands currently. I think it will need a lot of time/development to be usable. I suggest to base your solution on payment channels if you were thinking about LN.

### Good-ish

#### - Ethereum
#### - Rootstock

Ethereum is powerful as it gained a lot of traction, it's not simple and straightfoward as Bitcoin is (thanks Satoshi), but it's good as it's PoW and a lot of nice development is going in and around it.

### Somewhat Good

#### - LTC
#### - BCH
#### - BSV
#### - DOGE

At least are bitcoin forks, they're PoW, if you learn development in these you can apply it to BTC
Plus:

#### - Ethereum Classic

Of course!

### Privacy coins

#### - Monero
#### - Zcash

### Networks

- Cosmos/Tendermint/Lotion.js
- Polkadot/Substrate
- PoA network (xDai Bridge)

Networks are interesting, I believe we'll see some nice networks or peg-chains

### Peg Chains

- Rootstock (had to re-mention it again)
- Liquid

### Look "ok" to me

- Dash

- NANO

- Eth based tokens

(I would put all the top ERC20 tokens in this bucket here)

### Databases and "no comment"

- DIY Blockchain/Hashchain/Naivechain

- Stellar

- R3 Corda (at least they're honest, DLT, not a blockchain)

- Hyperledger Fabric

- EOS/IOTA/Ripple/the rest (no, not Tron, thanks :))


-----

That's my own opinion, please don't bash me :)

Also I don't know many coins I just focus and hava an opinion about the few top ones. 

Thanks for reading, hope you have a similar view to mine, especially if you are a developer and tried some of these blockchains.
