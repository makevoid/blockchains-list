# Personal list about blockchains

A developer view.

From Good to Databases.

All opinions are personal. 

### Good

- Bitcoin 

For both payments and OP_RETURN based use cases, Bitcoin gets the top place 

### Good-ish

- Ethereum
- Rootstock

Ethereum is powerful as it gained a lot of traction, it's not simple and straightfoward as Bitcoin is (thanks Satoshi), but it's good as it's PoW and a lot of nice development is going in and around it.

### Somewhat Good

- LTC
- BCH
- BSV
- DOGE

At least are bitcoin forks, they're PoW, if you learn development in these you can apply it to BTC
Plus:

- Ethereum Classic

Of course!

### Networks

- Cosmos/Tendermint/Lotion.js
- Polkadot/Substrate
- PoA network (xDai Bridge)

Networks are interesting, I believe we'll see some nice networks or peg-chains

### Peg Chains

- Rootstock (had to re-mention it again)
- Liquid

### Look "ok" to me

- Monero
- Zcash
- Dash

- NANO

- Eth based tokens

(I would put all the top ERC20 tokens in this bucket here)

### Databases and "no comment"

- DIY Blockchain/Hashchain/Naivechain

- Stellar

- R3 Corda (at least they're honest, DLT, not a blockchain)

- Hyperledger Fabric

- EOS/IOTA/Ripple/the rest (no, not Tron, thanks :))


-----

That's my own opinion, please don't bash me :)

Also I don't know many coins I just focus and hava an opinion about the few top ones. 

Thanks for reading, hope you have a similar view to mine, especially if you are a developer and tried some of these blockchains.
